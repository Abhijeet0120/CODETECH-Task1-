Overview of the project 
Project :LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
Objective:
In this task, we set up a library management system in SQL. First, we created three tables: Books, Members, and Transactions, each with unique columns for tracking book details, member information, and borrowing transactions. To simplify, we avoided foreign keys and focused on primary keys.We then added sample data to each table with INSERT statements. For managing data, we included UPDATE queries to modify records, DELETE queries to remove them, and SELECT statements for retrieval

Technologies Used
